#YourLocalChatBot
---
Your local chatbot is an easy to use, modifiable, and beginner friendly Chat Bot. YLCB is developed by [Granny](https://twitch.tv/depressionscr) and [\_Potato\_](https://twitch.tv/8potatochip8).

---
###Why should I use YLCB?
Because it is easy to use, frequently updated, we pay attention to user requests, and it is highly modifiable due to the use of discord.py's cog system

###What is the Cog System?
It is an easy way to load, reload, and unload files from use with the Discord API. 

###Why do you use a database?
We don't store personal data on our databases, only information you give us or information used internally within the bot itself (ex: your point balance or discord id)
